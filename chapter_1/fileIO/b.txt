NAME
       write - write to a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       write()  writes up to count bytes from the buffer starting at buf to the file referred to by
       the file descriptor fd.

       The number of bytes written may be less than count if, for example,  there  is  insufficient
       space  on  the underlying physical medium, or the RLIMIT_FSIZE resource limit is encountered
       (see setrlimit(2)), or the call was interrupted by a signal  handler  after  having  written
       less than count bytes.  (See also pipe(7).)
